We realized that there was no basic perceptron framework in Java.
So we decided to make it our own.

This Perceptron was built around the Torch framework.
Users can add hidden layers with no restrictions.

Our code uses matrices based matrices.
GUI is not used. So the operation can be very slow. :)
